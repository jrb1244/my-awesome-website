## Goals
I really want to work in research. I am interested in a lot of different fields, particularly the marine field. As I have been getting more involved in limnological studies, I have been finding myself getting drawn to limnology. I know I eventually want to get at least my masters, if not my PhD (we shall see). 

## Education
I am a senior zoology student at the University of New Hampshire, working towards my B.S. 

## Experience
I have worked in a few labs while being here. I have worked in the Ecological Acoustics Lab with Dr. Kleopper my freshman year. I worked on research looking at giraffe gate banging and then moose vocalizations (which we actually published!). Then, sophomore year, I worked in the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab with Dr. White. Junior year I went to New Zealand for a study abroad semester and did a lot of immersive research. Now I am working in the Lakes Lays Monitoring Porgram Lab under Amanda McQuaid. I am doing an independent study on toxicology, looking at cyanbacteria blooms in Wolfboro on Lake Winnipesaukee (it is really interesting!).
