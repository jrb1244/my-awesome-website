We used invertebrates as bioindicators to assess the role native vegetation had in restoring ecosystem function to an area that was very depleted in nutrients."

I also worked alongside volunteers and helped to educate them as well as the general public about the importance of water quality and how to conduct these tests on their own lakes."

We looked at how giraffes gate bangs represented their stress and prepared a summary paper to give to their team. In the spring, I researched and evaluated the frequencies of calls that cows, bulls, and calves made and what those calls could tell us about their behavior (were they rutting, communicating, warning calls, etc.). Myself along with two peers presented at Northeast Regional Environmental Acoustics Symposium as well as the URC at UNH in April 2023.\nDOI for paper: 10.1121/10.0025465"
